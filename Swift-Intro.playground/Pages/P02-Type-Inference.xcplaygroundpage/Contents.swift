 # Types
 If you want to store a certain type of a value (like a String or an Int) in a variable, you can do it as follows:
 */

var population : Int = 20

/*:
 From now on, `population` will always be an Integer (shortened as `Int`). Let's test it out by trying to set `population` to a decimal number.
 
 Uncomment the following line to see the error:
 */

// population = 15.343234

/*:
 The error says:
 `Cannot assign value of type 'Double' to a value of type 'Int'.` A `Double` is a number that can have decimal points. We told Swift we were going to give it an Integer, and instead we gave it a Double. Swift is sad.
 
 __Note: Make sure you comment the line again before continuing.__
 */

/*:
 # Type Inference
 
 In Swift, specifying the type of your value is optional. Swift can automatically infer, or guess, the type of value you're assigning to your variable. It's a pretty smart language.
 */

var humans = 10

/*:
 Even though we didn't use:

 var humans : Int
 
 Swift automatically knows the type of our variable because we assigned it to `10`, which is clearly an integer value. Let's try assigning a decimal number to `humans`. Remove the comment in the line below to see the error:
 */

// humans = 6.4342

/*:
 Silly programmer! You can't have four tenths of a person! Because Swift automatically inferred that `humans` is an `Int` when we first defined it, Swift won't let us assign a `Double` to it. No partial humans here.
 
 __Note: Make sure you comment the line above again before continuing.__
 */

/*:
 To check the type that Swift has inferred, hold down the "option" key on your keyboard while clicking on `pi` or `count` below:
 */

let pi = 3.14
var count = 5

/*:
 # Type Casting
 
 Sometimes, you'll have an Int that you want to convert to a Double. Or maybe you'll have a Double that you'll want to convert to an Int, and get rid of its fractional component. You do this thusly:
 */

let three = Int(pi)

/*:
 Note that __Swift will NOT automatically cast types for you!__ If you need to store something as an Double and you use Ints to compute the value, you must then _cast_ the value to a Double.
 */

// grossly inaccurate degrees to radians calculation
let degrees = 60 // Int
//let radians: Double = degrees  * pi / 180.0; // Don't do this!
let radians: Double = Double(degrees)  * pi / 180.0; // Better
